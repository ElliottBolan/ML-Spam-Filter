Hello! To run the project1.py you should be able to just put it in your IDE, install the libraries, and run it.
use the following command below to install the included libraries:

pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn

The logistic regression will take more time compared to the others but it does work.
I used VSCode, and Python 3.13.2
Please email me if you have any questions at:
